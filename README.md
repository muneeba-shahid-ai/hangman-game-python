# 🎓 Final Project: Hangman Game in Python

## 📖 Project Title  
**"Development of a Command-Line Based Word Guessing Game (Hangman) Using Python"**

## 🧠 Project Description  
This project implements a classic Hangman word-guessing game as a Python application. It serves as an engaging example of applying programming fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and user input handling. The game is run in a terminal and challenges users to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a fully functional terminal-based Hangman game.
- Apply core programming concepts in Python.
- Enhance user interaction using simple text-based UI.
- Allow easy extension for future GUI implementation or advanced features.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **IDE:** Any Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE)  
- **Dependencies:** None (uses standard Python libraries)

## 🛠️ How to Run
